This is the git repository for the Uni Master's Project applying machine learning to Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy

To run it, install anaconda from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

Then download this repository and navigate to it inside a Anaconda Prompt.

Enter: "conda env create -f environment.yml" to create a new environemnt called "rielk_project", identical to the one used to write these scripts.

Then "conda activate rielk_project" will activate the virtual environment.

To run any script, "python XX.py" will run a specific script in the anaconda prompt window, or "spyder" can be used to launch the spyder editor to view the contents of the script and run in an IPython window.
